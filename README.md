## *What to eat today* üçöü•¢

**- What will the application do? üçï** <br>
Don't know what to eat and don't want to cook? <br>
This application will help you **randomly choose your food today!**
It will randomly pick one restaurant from your favorite restaurants list, solving your time struggling with what to eat.

**- Who will use it? ü•¶** <br>
This program is helpful for anyone who does not know what to eat. No matter you are an excellent chef who wants to try a
new restaurant or a student who does not cook and is tired of deciding which restaurant to eat, this program will help
you save your time and make a good decision.

**- Why is this project of interest to me? üç§** <br>
This project is especially interesting to me because I had the same problem of choosing what to eat. I live in residence
and barely cook anything. I already tried most of the restaurants around campus and usually spent half an hour deciding
what to eat. I hope this application can help me save time, and help anyone who has the same problem.
